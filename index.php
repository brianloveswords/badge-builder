        Welcome to the Badge Builder prototype! The Badge Builder allows you
        to experiment with badges and make one of your own for your own
        website or to give to someone else. Badges can be used to signal
        achievements, skills, qualities or affiliations.
      </p>
      <h2>You can...</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="build/">Build a badge</a></li>
        <li><a href="view/">View all badges</a></li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <p role='description'>
        <strong>Note</strong> that this is a prototype: all badges are public,
        and things may break or go away. That said, we'll do our best to make
        sure things don't break.
